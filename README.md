# todo-list

I messed up big time;
After doing everything and realized it is all jumbled as you can see in the git commits. I decided to comment out most of my works and start afresh. 

1. Implement an actual localStorage: the localStorage.js module I created was a mess due to me not really understanding how local storage worked. Now I have it set up in Index.js and I deleted the localStorage module.

2. Put contents in the project.js module into a factory and sets its functions public.

3. Have only the task class in task.js.

4. Pass in the projects array to the getAllTasks function, instead of a separate allTasks array.

5. Use the project array only to generate allTasks, todayTasks function and the rest of the functions.

6. Make sure the delete, edit, addProject, addTask, and deleteProject buttons are working.

7. And so on..

8. I plan on revisiting this project to make it better.
